<h3> Meet the Fockers</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite films, it never gets old. It's easy watching, full of fun and humour. On top of that it has a fantastic cast.</p>

<h3> The Boat That Rocked </h3>
    <p>This film is a hidden gem, if you like the rock and roll era when pirate radio was at the forefront. Then this film will blow your socks off.</p>
    <p>It has an awesome soundtrack, array of characters that will keep you engaged and laughing throughout.</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
    <p>If Sci-fi is your thing, you are open minded and like delving deep into a story. This action packed and thought provoking set of films is a film you can't tear yourself away from.</p>
    <p>I truly think this is one of the most iconic films of my generation. </p>
