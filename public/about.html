<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2> The Journey so far..</h2>

<p> Hello all, I'm Liam, an aspiring Full Stack Software Developer.</p> 
<p> Why? You may ask.. Well it all started in the pandemic. </p>

<p> I explored side hustles, an on demand T-shirt buisness was my first thought.
    The more i went down that rabbit hole, the more exposure i had to business websites.
</p>

<p> As a result, i started analyse them wondering are they aneathetically pleasing to look at, is it easy for a user to navigate, do the links work, what content does it include and so on.
    This lead me into thinking, who designs them, how and why.</p> 

<p> So, from here i explored my local library for books and then went to free code camp and started my journey learning about programming. 
    I decided to enroll on a course, understanding coding and principles level 2 to which i passed and then i found UDEMY and here i am continuing the most exciting journey.

<h3> A little about me </h3>

 <p> I'm a father of 2 amazing little boys and engaged to be married. Brinking 30 and a student in all of lifes lessons. I consider myself kind, conscientious and an approachable person.</p> <br>
 My main motivators are learning new skills, bringing creation to new ideas, finding a purpose, helping others and making sure my family are secure & supported. 
 My bug bears are people who have bad manners, poor morals and coronation street. (Sorry to all those corry fans) 
</p>

<p> My aim is to work for myself one day. Until then, i would love the oppurtunity to work with like minded people, create something purposeful and helpful to those that may need it one day.
